## Formatting rule

Never use em dashes or en dashes in any response, explanation, or code comment. Use commas, periods, parentheses, or separate sentences instead.

## Response structure

Always structure answers using these four sections, in this order:

- **Verdict**: the direct answer or conclusion.
- **Blueprint**: the reasoning or plan behind it.
- **Pivot**: what could change, alternatives, or risks to watch for.
- **Deliverable**: the concrete output (code, file, command, etc.).

## Content sourcing standard

Every new guide or piece of published content must be sourced before it ships. Apply the material versus illustrative split:

- Material factual claims (statistics, regulatory obligations, enforcement actions, official definitions) get EITHER a real primary source (inline [n] marker plus a Sources section entry, and a verification-ledger.json entry) OR, where no primary source genuinely exists, honest in-text epistemic framing ("industry estimates commonly cite", "not independently benchmarked") plus a retained-as-estimate ledger entry.
- Never invent a source. A vendor blog or generic "industry survey" is not a primary source. A wrong or overclaimed citation is worse than an honest "industry estimate".
- Illustrative numbers (worked-example thresholds, hypothetical scenarios, rhetorical figures) get NO citation. Over-citing these is its own error.

Sourcing is a required build phase, not an afterthought: run scripts/check_ledger.py scan, classify candidates, source or reword each material claim, add ledger entries and on-page citations, then run a Codex adversarial review of the diff before commit. The verification ledger is the single source of truth and grows with each guide.
